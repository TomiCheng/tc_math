# tc_math

A Rust workspace for the integer arithmetic that cryptography builds on: big
integers in fixed-width, padded and arbitrary-precision forms, with
constant-time arithmetic for secret values. Each crate is published
separately and keeps its own README and changelog.

## Crates

| Crate | Version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`tc_bigint`](tc_bigint) | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tc_bigint.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tc_bigint) [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tc_bigint/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/tc_bigint) | Big integers in three kinds, each unsigned and signed: `FixedBigUint<N>` and `FixedBigInt<N>` on the stack, `PaddedBigUint` and `PaddedBigInt` at a width chosen at run time, and `BigUint` and `BigInt` at arbitrary precision. `no_std`, no `unsafe`; the heap types are behind a default-off `alloc` feature and random integers behind `rand_core`. The fixed-width and padded types are constant time; the big ones are variable time, for public values. |

## Requirements

Rust 1.85 or later, edition 2024. Every crate builds without `std` and
reaches the heap only through its default-off `alloc` feature.

Rust 1.85 is the earliest compiler for edition 2024, and it is guaranteed for
every build. Besides `tc_*` crates, the libraries depend only on `num-traits`
and, behind a feature, `rand_core`, both of which build on 1.85;
dev-dependencies used only by tests and benchmarks are exempt. The workspace
lock tracks the latest dependency releases, so CI on stable tests what a user
on a current toolchain resolves.

## Workspace checks

```text
cargo test --locked
cargo test --locked --all-features
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo doc --locked --no-deps --all-features
```

CI additionally runs these on Linux x64, i686 and ARM64, macOS ARM64, and
Windows x64, checks the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `aarch64-unknown-none`
targets and each crate's dependency set on each target, checks the build on
Rust 1.85.0, and verifies the package archive. See
[.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

Before a release, check each archive and run publication validation from a
committed checkout:

```text
cargo package -p <crate> --list --locked
cargo publish -p <crate> --dry-run --locked
```

The archive must include both license texts, the crate README, the changelog,
the source, the integration tests and the benchmarks with their results, and
no `target/` or other build artifacts.
