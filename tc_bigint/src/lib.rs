//! Big integers for cryptography, in three kinds, each unsigned and signed:
//!
//! - [`FixedBigUint`] and [`FixedBigInt`] hold `N` limbs on the stack, and
//!   need no allocator.
//! - `PaddedBigUint` and `PaddedBigInt` hold a width chosen when they are
//!   built, on the heap.
//! - `BigUint` and `BigInt` hold as many limbs as their value takes.
//!
//! The heap types are behind the `alloc` feature.
//!
//! `N` counts limbs, and a limb holds one [`Word`], 64 bits on 64-bit
//! targets and 32 otherwise, so a width in bits divides by `Word::BITS`:
//!
//! ```
//! use tc_bigint::{FixedBigUint, Word};
//!
//! type U256 = FixedBigUint<{ 256 / Word::BITS as usize }>;
//!
//! let x = U256::from(u128::MAX);
//! let y = &x * &x + 7u32;
//! assert_eq!(y.div_rem(&x), (x, U256::from(7u8)));
//! assert_eq!(y.bits(), 256);
//! ```
//!
//! # Timing
//!
//! The fixed-width and padded types work in constant time: their running
//! time follows their widths, which are public, and not their values. The
//! big types are variable time, as their length follows their value, and
//! are only for public values. Every method says which it is, and where a
//! public operand, such as a shift or an exponent, decides how far it runs.
//!
//! # Wiping
//!
//! The constant-time types wipe, through volatile writes, the working
//! values an operation of theirs makes and then gives up: the remainder a
//! division does not return, the power a square takes the place of, the
//! buffer a padded value outgrows. The values they hand back, and those
//! they are given, are the caller's to wipe, through `Zeroize` or
//! `Zeroizing`. What the compiler copies on its own is beyond reach: a value
//! moved on the stack may leave a copy behind, and a register or a spill may
//! keep a word of it. The big types wipe nothing of the kind, as they only
//! hold public values.
